## AI Virtual Quiz Game:
This is a simple virtual quiz game that works with gestures using OpenCV. We will import all the questions using a csv file and then use our hand in the air to answer them.


## Outcome:
Look for yourself in this <a href="#">video</a>.


## What Have I Done:
Firstly, I've created a Hand Tracking Module using openCV and MediaPipe. Then, I've created my AI Virtual Quiz Game. I've used a csv file for import all of our questions.

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it's used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.


## Required Packages:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the AIVirtualQuizGame.py file. 
- Now rise tour hands infont of your camera and use one finger to hover on the quizzes answers.
- Join your index finger and middle finger for make a click on your expected answer.
- Use the csv file for import your questions and answers.
