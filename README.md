## AI Virtual Quiz Game:
This is a simple virtual quiz game that works with gestures using OpenCV. We will import all the questions using a csv file and then use our hand in the air to answer them.

## What Have I Done:
Firstly, I've created a Hand Tracking Module using openCV, MediaPipe and Math. Then, I've created my AI Virtual Quiz Game using OpenCV, CSV, Time and Hand Tracking Module. I've used a csv file for import all of our questions and answers.

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it's used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.

Math is a built-in module that we can use for mathematical tasks.

CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is one of the most simple and common ways to store tabular data. To represent a CSV file, it must be saved with the .csv file extension. CSV is a build-in module that we can use for working with CSV files much easier.

Time is a built-in module that we can use for handle time-related tasks.


## Required Packages:
- opencv-python
- mediapipe
- math
- csv
- time


## Usage:
- First of all you need to install all required packages. 
- Then run the VirtualQuizGame.py file. 
- Now rise your hand in-front of your camera.
- Use one finger to hover on the quizzes answers.
- Join your index and middle finger to click on your expected answer.
- Use the csv file for import all of your questions and answers.
